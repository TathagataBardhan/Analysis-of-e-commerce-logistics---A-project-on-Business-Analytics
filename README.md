# Analysis-of-e-commerce-logistics---A-project-on-Business-Analytics
Worked on a dataset of e-commerce platform which contains information about sales, discounts, profits, and order quantities, region of sales, categories &amp; sub-categories of products along with customer segment.
Identified the amount of sales and profits across different customer segments and pointed out the areas of weaknesses in business in terms of loss with the help of Exploratory Data Analysis after necessary Feature Scaling & Data Cleaning.
Successfully analyzed some interesting business problems by developing ML Classification models & NN architecture to predict product categories and ML Regression models to predict profits on each order that would help them in framing business strategies.
